This is a collection of MATLAB codes to reproduce the convergence results presented in our paper 
"A high-order meshless linearly implicit energy-preserving method for nonlinear wave equations on Riemannian manifolds".

## Description

The main program is `test_convergence.m`, which requires the `nodes` and `sav_waveEq_sphere` files to be added to the MATLAB path.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

3. Add the necessary files to the MATLAB path:
addpath('nodes')
addpath('sav_waveEq_sphere')
